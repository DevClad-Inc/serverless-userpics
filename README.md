- [x] âœ¨ Serverless. Configurable. Easily deployable.

## Usage (Important)

### Routes

1. `api/getpic/`
2. `api/avatar/` - `?stream=True` query outputs an SVG for you.

### Quick and dirty example

1. Head over to [userpics.devclad.com](https://userpics.devclad.com) and "Get a random user pic".
2. Use the URL in your app.

### Python Example

- `/api/getpic/` is the endpoint to get a random avatar.

``` python
def random_avatar():
    name = str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]
    with open(f"media/avatars/{name}.png", "wb+") as f:
        url = requests.get("https://userpics.devclad.com/api/getpic")
        response = requests.get(url.text, stream=True)
        if not response.ok:
            raise Exception("Could not get avatar")
        for block in response.iter_content(1024):
            if not block:
                break
            f.write(block)
    return f"avatars/{name}.png"
```

You can try svg too btw, haven't tested it but it should work.

## Config

``` go
accountId := os.Getenv("ACCOUNT_ID")
bucketName := os.Getenv("BUCKET_NAME")
accessKeyId := os.Getenv("API_ACCESS_KEY")
accessKeySecret := os.Getenv("API_SECRET_KEY")
```

### Replicate this

1. Create an R2 bucket on Cloudflare.
2. Generate S3 Token via `Manage R2 API Tokens` in R2 Dashboard.
3. Set your environment variables.
4. Deploy âš¡

### Running locally

do the usual. install dependencies via `yarn` and run `yarn run start`/`yarn run dev`.

**Make sure to setup environment variables in your Vercel dashboard.**
**Also make sure to have S3 API access and secret on the recieving end if your bucket is private like mine.**
